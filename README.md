He\'s one of the lucky ones to be rescued from a rural NSW pound to start his new journey in finding his forever home. He makes his foster parents laugh and is very much an easy going pup. He\'s a very loving and affectionate boy who shares his love between all the family. He draws lots of attention when out on walks because he loves to say \"hello\" and is such a stunning looking pup. Whilst he loves hanging with this family, he is also happy to just relax in his comfy bed, or patch of grass. He\'s also proven to be quite a water-baby and loves a good splash.','http://res.cloudinary.com/pawhero/image/upload/v1630577567/pawheroimages/ctlcrfjv9bfskzqnij2j.png','Wentworthville, NSW','Mac','Male','Dog'),(3,'500.00','2 years 3 months ','Collie','Hey there its Spock here.

I’m an 11 month Dane X old puppy who really love humans, kids and other dogs. I’m not sure about cats as of yet! So far in life I’ve accomplished a few things; fully potty trained, can sit and give paw and most of all I can give the best slobbery kisses. My favorite things to do is running around, playing with a ball and taking long naps. But most of all is being with my humans, I understand that you guys have to go to work and I’m totally fine with that.\nI’ll just be waiting for your return with a big goofy smile on my face.','http://res.cloudinary.com/pawhero/image/upload/v1630583825/pawheroimages/b3nyilrfcsbgngwlv0av.png','Gladstone, QLD','Missy','Male','Dog'),(6,'400.00','3 years 6 months ','Japanese Spitz','He loves playing with toys and will bring balls back to play fetch. He loves his walks, he is strong but walks very well on lead. He is better suited to a home where someone is home more often and a home without children (he gets a bit over excited when they run around and throws his weight around). Trigger has not been tested with small dogs or cats. He currently sleeps through the night in a crate in his foster Mum’s bedroom. He has the short bursts of energy typical to greyhounds and spends the rest of his time lazing around. He has a big appetite and given half a chance will try to steal any unattended food. He very much loves human contact and would love to be your big sweet shadow.','http://res.cloudinary.com/pawhero/image/upload/v1630583975/pawheroimages/onk42qugnucmlnbpj0hj.png','Beaconsfield, VIC','Trigger','Male','Dog'),(7,'495.00','2 years 3 months ','Keeshond','We nicknamed him “Mr Energy”. So he is suited with a active family & best with another friendly dog. Would not suit an older person. He loves meeting other dogs, enjoys long walks. He comes when you whistle him. He still is very young & would benefit to doggie obedience classes or even agility. He still chew things if not kept busy. Loves his tucker & his occasional treat is a Pigs ear. Loves being inside & sleeps inside. Loves his cuddles.

Gentle, placid, chilled and also very playful & energetic with the right doggy companions. Khiva enjoys many games of chase, rumbles, tuggy and bitey face with her foster siblings and will play for hours each day. Nothing quite like a long nap in the sun after an exhausting play session, and Khiva has her favourite spot on the lounge for a well earned snooze. She\'s usually side by side with her foster brother in all things dog. Super affectionate with no sense of personal space, this girl will always be wanting to sit by you (or on you) for a cuddle and pat. Deeply bonding with her humans is in her nature as is her want to be naturally protective over them. Khiva will alert at the slightest sign of trouble and tell whoever or whatever that she knows they\'re there with a deep, rumbly bark.','http://res.cloudinary.com/pawhero/image/upload/v1630584198/pawheroimages/knyyeqqhyripht6u6g3i.png','Razorback, NSW','Khiva','Female','Dog'),(9,'649.98','1 year 5 months ','Pomeranian','Gentle, sweet and engaging, his favourite pastimes are playing, eating and snoozing. He is intelligent, eager to please and highly trainable. To be happy and content, Rudi will require plenty of space to move around and exercise, especially while he\'s young. Secure fencing is a must. Preference will be given to homes where someone is around most of the time and/or there is another dog of compatible size in residence. Prior breed experience and a commitment to training will be viewed very favourably.','http://res.cloudinary.com/pawhero/image/upload/v1630584334/pawheroimages/y3nnnao8dpugzxkyy7bj.png','Warwick, QLD','Rudi','Male','Dog'),(10,'300.00','1 year 4 months ','Samoyed','Marla is a lovely blue girl who has so much love for people! She can be a little shy at first but warms up quickly and then she is affectionate and sweet. Marla can be boisterous at times, so would benefit from attending some training classes with her new person. She would love a home where she can spend time on the couch with her people - preferably after a nice daily stroll. Marla seems to enjoy the company of other dogs, so would be keen to meet a friendly male playmate. In her time at the shelter Marla has displayed certain signs of anxiety and is presently on medication.Marla is a lovely girl and could require this\nongoing care within the home and will need a owner committed to her on going needs.','http://res.cloudinary.com/pawhero/image/upload/v1630584446/pawheroimages/c0yspbtrplgh8lbmrpxo.png','Weston, ACT','Marla','Female','Dog'),(11,'400.00','1 year 11 months ','Schnauzer','Franklin was found wandering and eating garbage on the street. He was super skinny and sad. He was wearing a chain around his neck that caused some injury. He was not loved at all. We took him into our care while wondering whether his owner would come forward. Franklin was not claimed by his owner. He only weighed 20.4kg and was ravenously hungry all the time. We have had Franklin for a little more than 8 weeks - and you can see the difference in him. Good food, some love and compassion makes a huge difference! He is like a completely different dog!','http://res.cloudinary.com/pawhero/image/upload/v1630584543/pawheroimages/teticvmcvimtswsxjtxo.png','Gilgandra, NSW','Franklin','Male','Dog'),(12,'650.00','0 year 11 months ','Great Dane','The gentlest puppy in the litter, Astro\'s favourite pastimes are playing, eating and snoozing.

She is overly affectionate and loves to give you kisses, be kissed, loves pats, loves being picked up and loves sitting on your lap. She basically loves to be around you/with you at all times and will follow you around for love. She really is a great cat, she can be a little unsure with new people until you gain her trust but once she does it’s non stop love. She also loves to sleep with you in bed. Misty is a food thief and will steal your food any chance she gets haha! She also hates other cats so would be suited to a house where she can be the only kitty. Misty purrs constantly, likes to sit on your shoulders and honestly will be someones absolute best friend.','http://res.cloudinary.com/pawhero/image/upload/v1630585586/pawheroimages/jedhvhzgpp6syhj9e2n8.png','Mandalong, NSW','Misty','Female','Cat'),(14,'195.00','0 year 6 months ','Bengal Cat','I didn\'t have the best start in life, so I\'ve been named to be treated like a queen in my forever home! I\'ll let you call me Cleo for short. I\'m in foster care at the moment getting lots of love and warmth to help me become my best self. I would love a quiet household as my forever home. I\'m not good with dogs or kids or even women. But I have taken a fancy to my foster dad, so if you\'re a guy looking for just a quiet girl to sit with you and watch Netflix and have snacks, I\'m you\'re girl! You\'ll need lots of patience with me, I may take about a month to trust you, but when I do, I\'ll love you lots and will pur like a machine for you.','http://res.cloudinary.com/pawhero/image/upload/v1630585701/pawheroimages/hrsbfs37kus6v69spdym.png','Shenton Park, WA','Cleopatra','Male','Cat'),(15,'150.00','6 years 5 months ','Maine Coon','Sox is super affectionate like his brother Flynn.

I love to play with all sorts of different toys and my boyfriend Goodi, whom I must be adopted with as a bonded pair. I was rescued from the streets on the Gold Coast after The Not Forgotten Ones Inc. had spent 2 months trying to trap my 2 brothers and I. I was quite easy to trap as I had a very badly broken leg from hip to foot and spent 7 weeks in hospital with our wonderful rescue vet, and 2 big operations later Dr Lance was able to not only save my leg, he also turned me from a wild, scared little girl to a wonderful loving little girl in the 7 weeks I was in hospital with him.','http://res.cloudinary.com/pawhero/image/upload/v1630586163/pawheroimages/adqg4efkglgtiqe600vt.png','Hervey Bay, QLD','Olli','Female','Cat'),(21,'100.00','8 years 2 months ','Toyger','Cyrus is a sweet, big, shy older boy. His time on the streets was hard - he still has a little scab on his nose that is healing, has almost no teeth and is FIV+. Amazingly, he is a big and beautiful docile boy who is comfortably settling into indoor life. Given his fair features and diagnosis, he would be better suited to an indoor life only from now on. Cyrus accepts all over body pats as long as your slow and gentle, he may give little hisses but it’s all for show as he’s never shown any signs of aggression. Being a little shy, he may hide at first but given time he will come out of his shell, he would enjoy a nice heated bed after living in the cold dirt for so long. He’s an expert with a litter box and very neat.','http://res.cloudinary.com/pawhero/image/upload/v1630586257/pawheroimages/z4brtmjgwonvohvt1pk9.png','Orelia, WA','Cyrus','Male','Cat'),(22,'100.00','2 years 1 month ','Kinkalow','For most of my life, as far back as I can remember, I lived very happily with my skin daddy until one day he just didn’t come home. I waited and waited as I knew how much he loved me and I loved him - he wouldn’t just leave without me, people came and said something I didn’t understand about him going to heaven, and that I would have to be surrendered to the pound. As you can imagine that was very scary, but the lovely lady there fed me and was so kind and reassuring. She told me not to worry and that someone from Perth Rescue Angels was coming to get me and that I would have lots of fun and love.','http://res.cloudinary.com/pawhero/image/upload/v1630586330/pawheroimages/usywlpsyqcycgcnwroav.png','Secret Harbour, WA','Nash','Male','Cat'),(23,'350.00','0 year 4 months ','Havana Brown','This fluffy, sweet faced kitten loves to cuddle with you!
